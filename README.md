# 🌱 Intelligence Farm

> 🚜 A living universe where agents grow like crops — simulated, evolved, harvested, and deployed for real-world superpowers.

## 🧬 What Is This?

This repo is the foundation of an **agentic farming platform** — a new kind of system where:

- Agents are **planted** into simulations like seeds
- They **grow** via context, tools, and recursive improvement
- The best agents are **harvested** into reusable tools or deployed services
- Over time, the system compounds value: **each agent can create better agents**

It’s not just automation.  
It’s recursive orchestration for exponential intelligence.

---

## 🧠 Why?

We’re building:
- A **platform**, not just a pipeline
- A system that makes **intelligence growable**
- A framework that **reimagines agent development** as an organic, evolving, value-seeking process

Think:
- LangChain x Evolutionary Systems x Strategic Planning
- Inspired by: Minsky’s Society of Mind, von Neumann self-replicators, and synthetic ecology
